## About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Alleluia ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at BINUS University, majoring in Data Science. My main interests are Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science applications.

I enjoy building models that can solve real-world problems, from detecting spam reviews to forecasting customer demand and predicting user behavior. I also like sharing knowledge through teaching and collaborating with others.

Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing the Fast Track program to continue my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science, while developing projects and research in applied machine learning.
