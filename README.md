## Projects
### Batik Image Classification using PyTorch | 2024
_Deep Learning Project_
[ See Repository!](https://github.com/AlleluiaRA-Ndolu/Batik-Image-Classification)

Developed a batik motif detection and prediction system using image classification technology leveraging the **PyTorch framework**. Successfully created a model capable of recognizing batik motifs with high accuracy, showcasing proficiency in **Python programming** and deep learning concepts.

### Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model with Machine Learning | 2024
_Model Deployment Project_
[ See repository!](https://github.com/AlleluiaRA-Ndolu/Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction)

Developed a bank customer churn prediction model using **Python**. Utilizing Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms, I analyzed historical data to identify factors influencing customer decisions to switch. The project involved data processing with Pandas, model implementation with Scikit-learn, and integration using FastAPI or Streamlit app for efficient deployment in production environments.

### Bank Loan Granting Prediction using Deep Learning | 2024
_Deep Learning Mid-Exam Project_
[ See repository!](https://github.com/AlleluiaRA-Ndolu/Bank-Loan-Granting-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning)

Developed a deep learning model for predicting bank loan granting decisions using **TensorFlow Keras**. The model was built from scratch with a baseline architecture consisting of an input layer, two hidden layers with ReLU activation, and an output layer. I optimized the model to improve accuracy by addressing challenges such as class imbalance through class weighting and feature scaling using Min-Max Scaler. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning was applied to further enhance performance.

### Image Classification using Custom VGG16 Architecture | 2024
_Deep Learning Project_
[See repository!](https://github.com/AlleluiaRA-Ndolu/Custom-VGG16-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Image-Classification-Using-PyTorch)

Developed an image classification model using a custom-built **VGG16 architecture** implemented from scratch in **PyTorch**. The model includes batch normalization and dropout layers to enhance performance and reduce overfitting. I optimized the model by tuning hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, to achieve improved accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset while effectively addressing challenges related to image data.
